## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of
conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to
uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to

## How to run this website locally

### Preliminaries

   1. If you still have not done so, [create your personal account on
GitHub](https://github.com/signup).

   2. [Fork this repository from
GitHub](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/geniuss-place/fork). This will copy the
whole website repository to your personal account.

   3. Then, go to your favorite working folder in your computer and
clone your forked repository by typing (replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` by
the actual username of your GitHub account):

          $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/geniuss-place

   4. Your forked repository https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/geniuss-place
will receive the default name of `origin`. You can also add the original
website repository, which is usually called `upstream`:

          $ cd geniuss-place
          $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/gnss-sdr/geniuss-place

To verify the new upstream repository you have specified for your fork,
type `git remote -v`. You should see the URL for your fork as `origin`,
and the URL for the original repository as `upstream`:

```
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/geniuss-place.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/geniuss-place.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/gnss-sdr/geniuss-place (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/gnss-sdr/geniuss-place (push)
```

### Install the required software and run a local copy of the website

The required software can be installed through
[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/), which is probably already installed in your
system. If this is not the case, please check [how to install
Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/), a tool for managing the required
dependencies:

```
$ gem install bundler
```

Clone your forked repository of this website and install the required
dependencies (replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` by your actual GitHub user name):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/geniuss-place/
$ cd geniuss-place
$ bundle install
```

After all gems are installed, the following command will deploy the website and
run a local server at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve -w --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml
```

You should see something as:

```
Configuration file: _config.yml
Configuration file: _config.dev.yml
            Source: /path_to_cloned_repo/geniuss-place
       Destination: /path_to_cloned_repo/geniuss-place/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating...
       Jekyll Feed: Generating feed for posts      
                    done in 4.017 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/path_to_cloned_repo/geniuss-place'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

Just point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ in order to enjoy this website
without the need for an Internet connection. Some features such as comments
might not work.

If you already forked and cloned this repo before, and then have pulled from
upstream, be sure to keep your gems updated with the exact required versions by
re-running:

```
$ bundle install
```

**Pro Tip**: if you want to modify JavaScript (under `assets/js`),
you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), `cd` to
the root of your project, and run `$ npm install` to get all the
dependencies. If all gone well, then running `npm run build:js` will
compress/concatenate `_main.js` and all plugin scripts into
`main.min.js`. Thus, upon a change on JavaScript content, run:

```
$ npm run build:js
```

in order to update the `main.js` script and implement the changes on
the website.


## Contributing to the source code of this website

When start working on a new improvement, please **always** branch off
from `main`. Open a new branch and start working on it:

```
$ git checkout -b my_feature
```

Now you can do changes, add files, do commits (please take a look at
[how to write good commit
messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!) and push them to
your repository:

```
$ git push origin my_feature
```

If there have been new pushes to the `main` branch of the `upstream`
repository since the last time you pulled from it, you might want to put
your commits on top of them (this is mandatory for pull requests):

```
$ git pull --rebase upstream main
```

### How to submit a pull request

When the contribution is ready, you can [submit a pull
request](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/geniuss-place/compare/). Head to your
GitHub repository, switch to your `my_feature` branch, and click the
_**Pull Request**_ button, which will do all the work for you.

Once a pull request is sent, the Developer Team can review the set of
changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up
commits if necessary.

For more details about Git usage, please check out [our
tutorial](https://gnss-sdr.org/docs/tutorials/using-git/).
