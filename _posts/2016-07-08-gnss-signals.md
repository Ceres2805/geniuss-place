A _generic_ GNSS complex baseband signal transmitted by a given GNSS space
vehicle $$ i $$ can be described as

$$ \begin{equation}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!s^{(i)}_T(t) = \sqrt{\mathcal{P}_{T}} \sum_{u=-\infty}^{\infty}\Big(d_I^{(i)}(u)g_I(t - uT_{b_I}) + j d_Q^{(i)}(u)g_Q(t - uT_{b_Q})\Big)~,
\end{equation} $$

where the Inphase and Quadrature (I&Q) components have the form

$$ \begin{equation}
g(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{N_{c}-1}q(t - kT_{PRN})
\end{equation} $$

with

$$ \begin{equation}
q(t) = \sum_{l=0}^{L_{c}-1}c_{i}(l)p(t - lT_{c}) ~,
\end{equation} $$


being $$ \mathcal{P}_{T} $$ the transmitting power, $$ d(u) $$ the navigation
message data symbols, $$ T_{b} $$ the bit period, $$ j $$ the imaginary unit, $$
N_{c} $$ the number of repetitions of a full codeword that spans a bit period, $$
T_{PRN}=\frac{T_{b}}{N_{c}} $$ the codeword period, $$ c_{i}(l) $$ a chip of the
spreading codeword of length $$ L_{c} $$ chips corresponding to the space
vehicle $$ i $$, $$ p(t) $$ the transmitting chip pulse shape, which is
considered energy-normalized for notation clarity, and $$
T_{c}=\frac{T_{b}}{N_{c} L_{c}} $$ the chip period. All parameters can be
different in the I and the Q components, there can be uneven power balance among
them, and everything will differ in each available frequency band.

This page describes particularizations of such signal structure for all the
currently deployed and planned GNSS signals. The notation used in those
descriptions is as follows: $$ \oplus $$ is the exclusive–or operation (modulo–2
addition), $$ |l|_{L} $$ means $$ l $$ modulo $$ L $$, $$ [l]_{L} $$ means the
integer part of $$ \frac{l}{L} $$, and $$ p(t) $$ is a rectangular pulse of a
chip–period duration, filtered at the transmitter at the nominal signal
bandwidth and energy-normalized. Links to the official Interface Control
Documents are provided in the [References](#references) section.

## Global Positioning System (GPS)

The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based radio–navigation
system owned by the United States Government (USG) and operated by the United
States Air Force (USAF). GPS provides positioning and timing services to
military and civilian users on a continuous, worldwide basis. Two GPS services
are provided:

- the Precise Positioning Service (PPS)[^GPS-PPS], available primarily to the
military of the United States and its allies, and

- the Standard Positioning Service (SPS)[^GPS-SPS], open to civilian users.

The most updated and authorized source is the [Official U.S. Government website
about GPS and related topics](https://www.gps.gov/).

### GPS L1

Defined in IS-GPS-200[^ISGPS200], this band is centered at $$ f_{\text{GPS
L1}}=1575.42 $$ MHz. The complex baseband transmitted signal can be written as

$$ \begin{equation}
s^{\text{(GPS L1)}}_{T}(t) = e_{L1I}(t) + j e_{L1Q}(t)~,
\end{equation} $$

with

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{L1I}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{NAV}}\Big[ [l]_{204600}\Big] \oplus C_{\text{P(Y)}} \Big[ |l|_{L_{\text{P(Y)}}} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{P(Y)}})~,
\end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{L1Q}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{NAV}}\Big[ [l]_{20460}\Big] \oplus C_{\text{C/A}} \Big[ |l|_{1023} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{C/A}})~,
\end{equation} $$

where $$ D_{\text{NAV}} \in \{-1,1\} $$ is the GPS navigation message bit
sequence, transmitted at $$ 50 $$ bit/s, $$ T_{c,\text{P(Y)}}=\frac{1}{10.23} $$
$$ \mu $$s, $$ T_{c,\text{C/A}}=\frac{1}{1.023} $$ $$ \mu $$s, and
$$ L_{\text{P(Y)}}=6.1871 \cdot 10^{12} $$. The precision P codes (named Y codes
whenever the anti-spoofing mode is activated, encrypting the code and thus
denying non–U.S. military users) are sequences of $$ 7 $$ days in length.

Regarding the modernization plans for GPS, it is worthwhile to mention that
there is a new civilian–use signal planned, called L1C and defined in
IS-GPS-800D[^ISGPS800], to be broadcast on the same L1 frequency that currently
contains the C/A signal. The L1C signal will be available with first Block III
launch, currently scheduled for May 2018 by SpaceX, and it will feature a
Multiplexed Binary Offset Carrier (MBOC) modulation scheme that ensures backward
compatibility with the C/A signal.

The L1C signal consists of two main components; one denoted $$ L1C_P $$ to
represent a pilot signal, without any data message, that is spread by a
ranging code, and $$ L1C_D $$ that is spread by a ranging code and modulated
by a data message. The $$ L1C_P $$ is also modulated by an SV unique overlay
code, $$ L1C_O $$. The SVs could transmit intentionally "incorrect" versions
of the respective ranging codes as needed to protect users from
receiving and utilizing anomalous signals. These "incorrect" codes are
termed non-standard $$ L1C_P $$ (NSCP) and non-standard $$ L1C_D $$ (NSCD).
Non-standard codes are not for utilization by the users and, therefore,
are not defined in IS-GPS-800D.

### GPS L2C

Defined in IS-GPS-200[^ISGPS200], this band is centered at
$$ f_{\text{GPS L2}}=1227.60 $$ MHz. The complex baseband
transmitted signal can be written as:

$$ \begin{equation}
s^{\text{(GPS L2)}}_{T}(t) = e_{L2I}(t) + j e_{L2Q}(t)~,
\end{equation} $$

with the In-phase component defined as:

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{L2I}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{NAV}}\Big[ [l]_{204600}\Big] \oplus C_{\text{P(Y)}} \Big[ |l|_{L_{\text{P(Y)}}} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{P(Y)}})~,
\end{equation} $$

with an optional presence of the navigation message $$ D_{\text{NAV}} $$. For
the Quadrature–phase component, three options are defined:

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
e_{L2Q}(t) & = & \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty}\left( D_{\text{CNAV}} \Big[ [l]_{10230} \Big] \oplus C_{\text{CM}} \Big[ |l|_{L_{\text{CM}}} \Big] p_{\text{1/2}} \left(t - lT_{c,L2C} \right) + \right. \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \left. +~C_{\text{CL}} \Big[ |l|_{L_{\text{CL}}} \Big] p_{\text{1/2}}\left(t - \left(l+\frac{1}{2}\right)T_{c,L2C}\right) \right)~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{L2Q}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{NAV}} \Big[ [l]_{20460} \Big] \oplus C_{\text{C/A}} \Big[ |l|_{1023} \Big] p \left(t - lT_{c,\text{C/A}}\right),
\end{equation} $$

or

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{L2Q}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty}C_{\text{C/A}} \Big[ |l|_{1023} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{C/A}})~,
\end{equation} $$

where $$ T_{c,L2C}=\frac{1}{511.5} $$ ms and $$ p_{\text{1/2}}(t) $$ is a
rectangular pulse of half chip–period duration, thus time-multiplexing both
codes. The civilian long code $$ C_{\text{CL}} $$ is $$ L_{\text{CL}}=767250 $$
chips long, repeating every $$ 1.5 $$ s, while the civilian moderate code $$
C_{\text{CM}} $$ is $$ L_{\text{CM}}=10230 $$ chips long and it repeats every $$
20 $$ ms. The CNAV data is an upgraded version of the original NAV navigation
message, containing higher precision representation and nominally more accurate
data than the NAV data. It is transmitted at $$ 25 $$ bit/s with forward error
correction (FEC) encoding, resulting in $$ 50 $$ symbols/s.

{: style="text-align: center;"}

GPS L2C is only available on Block IIR–M and subsequent satellite blocks.

### GPS L5

The GPS L5 link, defined in IS-GPS-705[^ISGPS705], is only available on Block
IIF and subsequent satellite blocks. Centered at $$ f_{\text{GPS L5}}=1176.45 $$
MHz, this signal in space can be written as:

$$ \begin{equation}
s^{\text{(GPS L5)}}_{T}(t) = e_{L5I}(t) + j e_{L5Q}(t)~,
\end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
e_{L5I}(t) & = & \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} C_{nh_{10}} \Big[ |m|_{10}\Big] \oplus D_{\text{CNAV}}\Big[ [m]_{10}\Big] \oplus \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \oplus~\sum_{l=1}^{102300} C_{L5I}\Big[|l|_{10230}\Big] \cdot p(t - m T_{c,nh} - lT_{c,L5}) ~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

$$ \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\begin{equation}
e_{L5Q}(t) = \!\!\sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty}\!\! C_{nh_{20}} \Big[ |m|_{20}\Big] \oplus \!\!\sum_{l=1}^{102300}\!\!C_{L5Q}\Big[|l|_{10230}\Big] \! \cdot\! p(t \! - \! m T_{c,nh} \! - \! lT_{c,L5})~,
\end{equation} $$

where $$ T_{c,nh}=1 $$ ms and $$ T_{c,L5}=\frac{1}{10.23} $$ $$ \mu $$s. The L5I
component contains a synchronization sequence $$ C_{nh_{10}}=0000110101 $$,
a $$ 10 $$–bit Neuman–Hoffman code that modulates each $$ 100 $$ symbols of the
GPS L5 civil navigation data $$ D_{\text{CNAV}} $$, and the L5Q component
has another synchronization sequence $$ C_{nh_{20}}=00000100110101001110 $$.

## GLONASS

The nominal baseline constellation of the Russian Federation's Global Navigation
Satellite System (GLONASS) comprises $$ 24 $$ GLONASS–M satellites that are
uniformly deployed in three roughly circular orbital planes at an inclination of
$$ 64.8^o $$ to the equator. The altitude of the orbit is $$ 19,100 $$ km. The
orbit period of each satellite is $$ 11 $$ hours, $$ 15 $$ minutes, and $$ 45 $$
seconds. The orbital planes are separated by $$ 120^o $$ right ascension of the
ascending node. Eight satellites are equally spaced in each plane with $$ 45^o $$
argument of latitude. Moreover, the orbital planes have an argument of latitude
displacement of $$ 15^o $$ relative to each other. The current constellation
status can be checked at the Russian [Information and Analysis Center for
Positioning, Navigation and Timing website](https://www.glonass-iac.ru/en/).

The ground control segment of GLONASS is almost entirely located within former
Soviet Union territory, except for a station in Brasilia, Brazil. The Ground
Control Center and Time Standards is located in Moscow and the telemetry and
tracking stations are in Saint Petersburg, Ternopol, Eniseisk, and
Komsomolsk-na-Amure.

GLONASS civil signal–in–space is defined in GLONASS' ICD [^GLONASS08]. This
system makes use of a frequency–division multiple access (FDMA) signal
structure, transmitting in two bands:

 * $$ f^{(k)}_{GLO L1}=1602+k \cdot 0.5625 $$ MHz and
 * $$ f^{(k)}_{GLO L2}=1246+k \cdot 0.4375 $$ MHz,

where $$ k\in \left\{ -7,-6,\cdots,5,6\right\} $$ is the channel number.
Satellites in opposite points of an orbit plane transmit signals on equal
frequencies, as these satellites will never be in view simultaneously by a
ground-based user.

The modernization of GLONASS includes the adoption of the CDMA
scheme[^GLONASS16], with new open signals called L1OC, L2OC, and L3OC.



### GLONASS L1

Two kinds of signals are transmitted: a standard precision (SP) and an
obfuscated high precision (HP) signal. The complex baseband transmitted signal
can be written as

$$ \begin{equation}
s^{\text{(GLO L1)}}_{T}(t) = e_{L1I}(t) + j e_{L1Q}(t)~,
\end{equation} $$

with

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{L1I}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{GNAV}}\Big[ [l]_{102200}\Big] \oplus C_{\text{HP}} \Big[ |l|_{L_{\text{HP}}} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{HP}})~,
\end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{L1Q}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{GNAV}}\Big[ [l]_{10220} \Big] \oplus C_{\text{SP}} \Big[ |l|_{511} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{SP}})~,
\end{equation} $$

where $$ T_{c,\text{HP}}=\frac{1}{5.11} $$ $$ \mu $$s,
$$ T_{c,\text{SP}}=\frac{1}{0.511} $$ $$ \mu $$s, and
$$ L_{\text{HP}}=3.3554\cdot 10^7 $$. The navigation message
$$ D_{\text{GNAV}} $$ is transmitted at $$ 50 $$ bit/s. Details of its content and
structure, as well as the generation of the $$ C_{\text{SP}} $$ code, can be
found in GLONASS' ICD [^GLONASS08]. The usage of the HP signal should be agreed upon with
the Russian Federation Defense Ministry, and no more details have been
disclosed.

{: style="text-align: center;"}

The use of FDMA techniques, in which the same code is used to broadcast
navigation signals on different frequencies, and the placement of civil GLONASS
transmissions on frequencies centered at $$ 1602 $$ MHz, well above the GPS L1
band, have complicated the design of combined GLONASS/GPS receivers,
particularly low–cost equipment for mass-market applications.

In late 2016, the Russian Federation published a new ICD related to a CDMA
signal at $$ 1600.99 $$ MHz, referred to as L1OC, to be broadcast by GLONASS
satellites starting by Enhanced Glonass-K1 and Glonass-K2, launched from 2018.
This documentation is only available in Russian [^GLONASS16-1].




### GLONASS L2

Beginning with the second generation of satellites, called GLONASS–M and first
launched in 2001, a second civil signal is available using the same SP code as
the one in the L1 band but centered at $$ 1246 $$ MHz.

![Spectra GLONASS Signals L2]({{ "/assets/images/Spectra_GLONASS_Signals_L2.png" | relative_url }}){: .align-center .invert-colors}
_GLONASS signals spectra in L2. Source: [Navipedia](https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/GLONASS_Signal_Plan)_.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Future plans of modernization are intended to increase compatibility and
interoperability with other GNSS, and include the addition of a code-division
multiple access (CDMA) structure.

On July 2, 2013, a Russian Proton-M rocket carrying three GLONASS–M navigation
satellites [crashed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpBYCLu6kXA) soon after
liftoff today from Kazakhstan’ Baikonur cosmodrome.

In late 2016, the Russian Federation published a new ICD related to a CDMA
signal at $$ 1248.06 $$ MHz, referred to as L2OC and featuring a BOC(1,1)
modulation, to be broadcast by GLONASS satellites starting by Enhanced
Glonass-K1 and Glonass-K2, to be launched from 2018. This documentation is only
available in Russian [^GLONASS16-2].



### GLONASS L3

In late 2016, the Russian Federation published a new ICD related to a CDMA
signal at $$ 1202.025 $$ MHz, referred to as L3OC and featuring a BPSK(10)
modulation, to be broadcast by GLONASS satellites starting by Glonass-M, in
production since 2014. This documentation is only available in Russian
[^GLONASS16-3].


## Galileo

The nominal Galileo constellation comprises a total of $$ 24 $$ operational
satellites (plus $$ 6 $$ active spares), that are evenly distributed among three
orbital planes inclined at $$ 56^o $$ relative to the equator. There are eight
operational satellites per orbital plane, occupying evenly distributed orbital
slots. Six additional spare satellites (two per orbital plane) complement the
nominal constellation configuration. The Galileo satellites are placed in
quasi-circular Earth orbits with a nominal semi-major axis of about $$ 30,000 $$
km and an approximate revolution period of $$ 14 $$ hours. The Control segment
full infrastructure will be composed of $$ 30-40 $$ sensor stations, $$ 3 $$
control centers, $$ 9 $$ Mission Uplink stations, and $$ 5 $$ TT&C stations. The
current constellation status can be checked at the [European GNSS Service Centre
website](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/system-service-status/constellation-information).

Galileo's Open Service is defined in the Service Definition Document
(SDD)[^GalileoSSD], and the corresponding signal structures are defined in the
Interface Control Document (ICD)[^GalileoICD]. In this latter document, the
following signal structures are specified:

### Galileo E1

This band, centered at $$ f_{\text{Gal E1}}=1575.420 $$ MHz and with a reference
bandwidth of $$ 24.5520 $$ MHz, uses the Composite Binary Offset Carrier (CBOC)
modulation, defined in baseband as:

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
s^{\text{(Gal E1)}}_{T}(t) & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big( e_{E1B}(t)\left(\alpha sc_A(t) + \beta sc_B(t) \right) + \nonumber \\
{} & {} & -~e_{E1C}(t) \left(\alpha sc_A(t) - \beta sc_B(t) \right) \Big)~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

where the subcarriers $$ sc(t) $$ are defined as

$$ \begin{equation} sc_A(t) = \text{sign} \Big(\sin(2\pi f_{sc,E1A}t) \Big)~, \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} sc_B(t) = \text{sign} \Big(\sin(2\pi f_{sc,E1B}t) \Big)~, \end{equation} $$

and $$ f_{sc,E1A}=1.023 $$ MHz, $$ f_{sc,E1B}=6.138 $$ MHz are the subcarrier
rates, $$ \alpha=\sqrt{\frac{10}{11}} $$, and $$ \beta=\sqrt{\frac{1}{11}} $$.
Channel B contains the I/NAV type of navigation message,
$$ D_{I/NAV} $$, intended for Safety–of–Life (SoL) services:

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{E1B}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{+\infty} D_{\text{I/NAV}} \Big[ [l]_{4092}\Big] \oplus C_{E1B}\Big[|l|_{4092}\Big] p(t - lT_{c,E1B})~.
\end{equation} $$

In the case of channel C, it is a pilot (dataless) channel with a secondary
code, forming a tiered code:

$$ \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\begin{equation}
e_{E1C}(t) \! = \!\! \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} \! C_{E1Cs}\Big[|m|_{25}\Big] \! \oplus \! \sum_{l=1}^{4092} \! C_{E1Cp}\Big[ l \Big] \! \cdot \! p(t \! - \! mT_{c,E1Cs} \! - \! lT_{c,E1Cp})~,
\end{equation} $$

with $$ T_{c,E1B}=T_{c,E1Cp}=\frac{1}{1.023} $$ $$ \mu $$s and $$ T_{c,E1Cs}=4 $$
ms. The $$ C_{E1B} $$ and $$ C_{E1Cp} $$ primary codes are pseudorandom memory
code sequences defined in Galileo's ICD[^GalileoICD] [Annex C]. The binary
sequence of the secondary code $$ C_{E1Cs} $$ is $$ 0011100000001010110110010 $$.
This band also contains another component, Galileo E1A, intended for the
Public Regulated Service (PRS), that uses a BOC modulation with
cosine–shaped subcarrier, $$ f_{sc,E1A}=15.345 $$ MHz, and
$$ T_{c,E1A}=\frac{1}{2.5575} $$ $$ \mu $$s. The PRS spreading codes and the
structure of the navigation message have not been made public.

### Galileo E6

Galileo will provide users with added-value services offered through the E6
band, namely:

* The **Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS)** will allow users to obtain a
positioning error below two decimeters in nominal conditions of use, worldwide.
The Galileo HAS will be based on the free transmission of Precise Point
Positioning (PPP) corrections through the Galileo E6 signal data component $$
e_{E6B}(t) $$ by the Galileo satellites.
* The **Galileo Commercial Authentication Service (CAS)** will make it possible
to authenticate signals, allowing for increased robustness of professional
applications by giving access to the E6 signal pilot component $$ e_{E6C}(t) $$
codes, which will be encrypted.

This signal, which is centered at $$ f_{\text{Gal E6}}=1278.750 $$ MHz, has a
pilot and a data component:

$$ \begin{equation}
s_{T}^{\text{(Gal E6)}}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(e_{E6B}(t) - e_{E6C}(t)\right)~,
\end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{E6B}(t) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} D_{\text{HAS}} \Big[ [m]_{5115}\Big] \oplus C_{E6B}\Big[|m|_{5115}\Big] \cdot p(t - mT_{c,E6B})~,
\end{equation} $$

$$ \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\begin{equation}
e_{E6C}(t) \! = \!\!\! \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} \! C_{E6Cs}\Big[|m|_{100}\Big] \! \oplus \! \sum_{l=1}^{L_{E6C}} \!\! C_{E6Cp}\Big[ l \Big]\! \cdot \! p(t \! - \! mT_{c,E6Cs} \! - \! lT_{c,E6Cp}),
\end{equation} $$

where $$ D_{\text{HAS}} $$ is the HAS navigation data stream, which is modulated
with the ranging code $$ C_{E6B} $$ with chip period $$
T_{c,E6B}=\frac{1}{5.115} $$ $$\mu $$s. Codes $$ C_{E6B} $$, $$ C_{E6Cp} $$ and $$
C_{E6Cs} $$ are published in Galileo's E6-B/C Codes Technical Note[^GalileoE6].

This band also contains another component, Galileo E6A, intended for the Public
Regulated Service (PRS). It uses a BOC modulation with cosine–shaped subcarrier, $$
f_{sc,E6A}=10.23 $$ MHz, and $$ T_{c, E6A}=\frac{1}{5.115} $$ $$ \mu $$s. The
PRS spreading codes and the structure of the navigation message are not publicly
available.

### Galileo E5 {#subsec:GalileoE5}

Centered at $$ f_{\text{Gal E5}}=1191.795 $$ MHz and with a total (baseband)
bandwidth of $$ 51.150 $$ MHz, its signal structure deserves some analysis. The
AltBOC modulation can be generically expressed as

$$ \begin{equation} s^{\text{AltBOC}}(t) = x_1(t)v^{*}(t) + x_2(t)v(t)~, \end{equation} $$

where
$$ v(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \text{sign}\left( \cos (2 \pi f_{sc,E5} t)\right)+j \text{sign}\left( \sin (2 \pi f_{sc,E5} t)\right)\right) $$
is the single side-band subcarrier, $$ f_{sc,E5} $$ is the subcarrier frequency,
$$ (\cdot)^{*} $$ stands for the conjugate operation, and $$ x_1(t) $$ and
$$ x_2(t) $$ are QPSK signals. The resulting waveform does not exhibit a
constant envelope. In the case of Galileo, the need for high efficiency of the
satellites’ onboard High Power Amplifier (HPA) has pushed a modification on the
signal in order to make it envelope-constant and thus use the HPA at saturation.
This can be done by adding some inter-modulation products to the expression
above, coming up with the following definition:

$$ \begin{eqnarray} s^{\text{(Gal E5)}}_{T}(t) & = & e_{E5a}(t) ssc_s^{*}(t)+ e_{E5b}(t)ssc_s(t) + \nonumber \\
{} & {} & +~\bar{e}_{E5a}(t)ssc_p^{*}(t)+\bar{e}_{E5b}(t)ssc_p(t)~, \end{eqnarray} $$

where the single and product side-band signal subcarriers are

$$ \begin{equation} ssc_s(t) = sc_s(t) +jsc_s\left(t-\frac{T_s}{4}\right) ~, \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} ssc_p(t) = sc_p(t) +jsc_p\left(t-\frac{T_s}{4}\right) ~, \end{equation} $$

and

$$ \begin{equation} e_{E5a}(t) = e_{E5aI}(t)+je_{E5aQ}(t)~, \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} e_{E5b}(t) = e_{E5bI}(t)+je_{E5bQ}(t)~, \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} \bar{e}_{E5a}(t) = \bar{e}_{E5aI}(t)+j\bar{e}_{E5aQ}(t)~, \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} \bar{e}_{E5b}(t) = \bar{e}_{E5bI}(t)+j\bar{e}_{E5bQ}(t)~, \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} \bar{e}_{E5aI}(t) = e_{E5aQ}(t)e_{E5bI}(t)e_{E5bQ}(t)~, \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} \bar{e}_{E5aQ}(t) = e_{E5aI}(t)e_{E5bI}(t)e_{E5bQ}(t)~, \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} \bar{e}_{E5bI}(t) = e_{E5bQ}(t)e_{E5aI}(t)e_{E5aQ}(t)~, \end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} \bar{e}_{E5bQ}(t) = e_{E5bI}(t)e_{E5aI}(t)e_{E5aQ}(t). \end{equation} $$

The signal components are defined as

$$ \begin{eqnarray} e_{E5aI}(t) & = & \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty}C_{E5aIs}\Big[|m|_{20}\Big] \oplus \sum_{l=1}^{10230}C_{E5aIp}\Big[ l \Big] \oplus \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \oplus~D_{\text{F/NAV}} \Big[ [l]_{204600}\Big] p(t-mT_{c,E5s}-lT_{c,E5p})~, \end{eqnarray} $$

$$ \begin{eqnarray} e_{E5aQ}(t) & = & \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty}C_{E5aQs}\Big[|m|_{100}\Big] \oplus \sum_{l=1}^{10230}C_{E5aQp}\Big[ l \Big] \cdot\nonumber \\
{} & {} & \cdot~p(t-mT_{c,E5s}-lT_{c,E5p})~, \end{eqnarray} $$

$$ \begin{eqnarray} e_{E5bI}(t) & = & \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty}C_{E5bIs}\Big[|m|_{4}\Big] \oplus \sum_{l=1}^{10230}C_{E5aIp}\Big[ l \Big] \oplus \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \oplus~D_{\text{I/NAV}} \Big[ [l]_{40920}\Big] p(t-mT_{c,E5s}-lT_{c,E5p})~, \end{eqnarray} $$

$$ \begin{eqnarray} e_{E5bQ}(t) & = & \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty}C_{E5bQs}\Big[|m|_{100}\Big] \oplus \sum_{l=1}^{10230}C_{E5bQp}\Big[ l \Big] \cdot\nonumber \\
{} & {} & \cdot~p(t-mT_{c,E5s}-lT_{c,E5p})~, \end{eqnarray} $$


where $$ T_{c,E5s}=1 $$ ms and $$ T_{c,E5p}=\frac{1}{10.23} $$ $$ \mu $$s.
Channel A contains the F/NAV type of navigation message, $$ D_{F/NAV} $$,
intended for the Open Service. The I/NAV message structures for the E5bI and E1B
signals use the same page layout. Only page sequencing is different, with page
swapping between both components in order to allow a fast reception of data by a
dual-frequency receiver. The single subcarrier $$ sc_s(t) $$ and the product
subcarrier $$ sc_p(t) $$  are defined as:

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
\!\!\!\!\! sc_s(t) & = & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\text{sign} \left( \cos \left( 2 \pi f_{sc,E5} t - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right)+\frac{1}{2}\text{sign} \Big( \cos \left( 2 \pi f_{sc,E5} t \right) \Big)+ \nonumber \\
{} & {} & + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\text{sign} \left( \cos \left( 2 \pi f_{sc,E5} t + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right)~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!sc_p(t) & = & -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\text{sign} \left( \cos \left( 2 \pi f_{sc,E5} t - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right)+ \frac{1}{2}\text{sign} \Big( \cos \left( 2 \pi f_{sc,E5} t \right) \Big)+\nonumber \\
{} & {} & -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\text{sign} \left( \cos \left( 2 \pi f_{sc,E5} t + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right)~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

with a subcarrier frequency of $$ f_{sc,E5} = 15.345 $$ MHz.

Plotting the power spectrum of the carriers for $$ s^{\text{(Gal E5)}}_{T}(t) $$
(see Figure below), we can see that the QPSK signal $$ e_{E5a}(t) $$ defined
above is shifted to $$ f_{\text{Gal E5a}} \doteq f_{\text{Gal E5}} -
f_{sc,E5} = 1176.450 $$ MHz, while $$ e_{E5b}(t) $$ is shifted to
$$ f_{Gal E5b} \doteq f_{\text{Gal E5}} + f_{sc,E5} = 1207.140 $$ MHz.

_Power spectrum of single and product side-band subcarriers signals for $$
s^{\text{(Gal E5)}}_{T}(t) $$, normalized to the power of $$ ssc^{*}_s(t) $$ at $$
f_{\text{Gal E5a}} $$. The modified AltBOC modulation can be well approximated
by two QPSK signals $$ 2 f_{sc,E5} $$ apart, with negligible contribution of the
crossed terms around its center frequency._[^Fernandez11]
{: style="text-align: center;"}



Thus, we can bandpass filter around $$ f_{Gal E5a} $$ and get a good
approximation of a QPSK signal, with very low energy components of $$ e_{E5b}(t) $$, $$
\bar{e}_{E5a}(t) $$, and $$ \bar{e}_{E5b}(t) $$:

$$ \begin{equation} s_{T}^{(Gal E5a)}(t) \simeq e_{E5aI}(t)+je_{E5aQ}(t). \end{equation} $$

The same applies to $$ e_{E5b}(t) $$, allowing an independent reception of two
QPSK signals and thus requiring considerably less bandwidth than the processing
of the whole E5 band.

## BeiDou

People's Republic of China was also concerned with the importance of an accurate
(and independent) navigation and timing satellite system.

According to the China National Space Administration, in a communicate dated on
May 19, 2010, the development of the system would be carried out in three steps:

* 2000 – 2003: China built the BeiDou Satellite Navigation Experimental
  System, also known as BeiDou-1, consisting of 3 satellites. It offered
  limited coverage and applications and nowadays is not usable.
* by 2012: regional BeiDou navigation system covering China and
  neighboring regions.
* by 2020: global BeiDou navigation system.

The second generation of the system, officially called the BeiDou Satellite
Navigation System (BDS) and also formerly known as COMPASS or BeiDou-2, will be
a global satellite navigation system consisting of $$ 5 $$ geostationary
satellites and $$ 30 $$ non–geostationary satellites. The geostationary
satellites will be located at $$ 58.75^o $$ E, $$ 80^o $$ E, $$ 110.5^o $$ E, $$
140^o $$ E and $$ 160^o $$ E. Non–geostationary satellites will be in
medium–Earth orbit (MEO) and inclined geosynchronous orbit. Global coverage is
planned by 2020. The ground segment will consist of one Master Control Station,
two Upload Stations and $$ 30 $$ Monitor Stations.

After the first geostationary satellite (located at $$ 140^o $$ E) was launched
on October 31, 2000, a second satellite (located at $$ 80^o $$ E) and a third
satellite (located at $$ 110.5^o $$ E) were launched on December 21, 2000, and
May 25, 2003, respectively.  The first geostationary satellite, COMPASS–G2, was
launched on April 15, 2009.

On December 27, 2012, the Chinese government released the first version of
BeiDou's Interface Control Document (ICD), a 77-page document that included
details of the navigation message, including parameters of the satellite
almanacs and ephemerides that were missing from a "test version" of the ICD
released exactly one year before. One year later version 2.0 was released,
version 2.1 followed in November 2016[^Beidou], and version 3.0 in February
2019[^BeidouB1I]. Starting 2018, version 1.0 of the ICD for B1C[^BeidouB1C],
B2a[^BeidouB2a] and B3I[^BeidouB3I] signals were released, describing the open
services deployed in the BSD-3 phase of the system development.

![BeiDou Logo]({{ "/assets/images/BeiDou-Logo.png" | relative_url }}){:height="250px" width="250px"}{: .align-left}
On December 2012, the China Satellite Navigation Office released the
official logo of the BeiDou system, the design of which incorporates the
yin/yang symbol reflecting traditional Chinese culture, dark and light
blue coloration symbolizing, respectively, space and Earth (including
the aerospace industry), and the Big Dipper (a pattern of stars
recognized on Earth's night sky which star components are the seven
brightest of the constellation Ursa Major) used for navigation since
ancient times to locate the North Star Polaris and representing the
first navigation device developed by China.
{: .notice--info}


It also appeared that China intended to discontinue the use of COMPASS as the
English name for BeiDou. During the press briefing about the publication of the
ICD, Ran Chengqi, director of China Satellite Navigation Office, said the
English designation will henceforth be BeiDou Navigation Satellite System with
the abbreviation BDS.

Updated information can be found at the [Beidou Navigation Satellite System
website](http://en.beidou.gov.cn/). The status of the constellation can be
consulted [here](http://www.csno-tarc.cn/en/system/constellation).


### Beidou B1I

BeiDou B1 transmitted by BDS-2 satellites is centered at $$ f_{B1} = 1561.098 $$
MHz, featuring a QPSK(2) modulation. The complex baseband transmitted signal can
be written as:

$$ \begin{equation}
s^{\text{(BeiDou B1)}}_{T}(t) = e_{B1I}(t) + j e_{B1Q}(t)~,
\end{equation} $$

with

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{B1I}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{NAV}}\Big[ [l]_{40920}\Big] \oplus C_{\text{B1I}} \Big[ |l|_{2046} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{B1I}})~,
\end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{B1Q}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{NAV}}\Big[ [l]_{\text{N/A}}\Big] \oplus C_{\text{B1Q}} \Big[ |l|_{L_{\text{B1Q}}} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{B1Q}})~,
\end{equation} $$

Beidou's Interface Control Document version 3.0 describes the Inphase-component
of the Beidou B1 link.[^BeidouB1I] The chip rate of the B1I ranging code,
$$ C_{B1I} $$ is 2.046 Mcps, and the length is 2046 chips.

The B1I signal is also transmitted by all satellites of BDS-3.


### BeiDou B1C

BeiDou Open Service B1C signals, transmitted by Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
satellites and the Inclined GeoSynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites of BDS-3, are
centered at $$ f_{B1C} = 1575.42 $$ MHz and feature a BOC(1,1) modulation in the
data component and a QMBOC(6, 1, 4/33) modulation in the pilot component. The
complex baseband transmitted signal can be written as:[^BeidouB1C]

$$ \begin{equation}
s^{\text{(BeiDou B1C)}}_{T}(t) = e_{B1C\_data}(t) + j e_{B1C\_pilot}(t)~,
\end{equation} $$

with

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
e_{B1C\_data}(t) & = & \frac{1}{2} \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{B-CNAV1}}\Big[ [l]_{10230}\Big] \oplus \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \oplus~C_{B1C\_data} \Big[ |l|_{10230} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,B1C\_data}) sc_{B1C\_data}(t)~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
e_{B1C\_pilot}(t) & = & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} \Big[ [l]_{10230} \Big] \oplus \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \oplus~C_{B1C\_pilot} \Big[ |l|_{10230} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,B1C\_pilot})sc_{B1C\_pilot}(t)~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

where:

$$ \begin{equation}
sc_{B1C\_data}(t) = \text{sign} \left(\sin \left(2 \pi f_{sc\_B1C\_a} t \right) \right)~,
\end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
sc_{B1C\_pilot}(t) & = & \sqrt{\frac{29}{33}} \text{sign} \left(\sin \left(2 \pi f_{sc\_B1C\_a} t \right) \right) + \nonumber \\
{} & {} & - j \sqrt{\frac{4}{33}} \text{sign} \left(\sin \left(2 \pi f_{sc\_B1C\_b} t \right) \right)~ ,
\end{eqnarray} $$

with $$ f_{sc\_B1C\_a} = 1.023 $$ MHz and $$ f_{sc\_B1C\_b} = 6.138 $$ MHz. The
code length of the ranging codes $$ C_{B1C\_data} $$ and $$ C_{B1C\_pilot} $$ is
10230 chips, and $$ T_{c,B1C\_data} = T_{c,B1C\_pilot} = \frac{1}{1.023} $$
$$\mu $$s. Both of data and pilot ranging codes are tired codes composed of
primary and secondary codes. For both data and pilot channels, the primary and
secondary codes are generated from Weil sequences, and the starting boundaries
of the primary and secondary codes are strictly synchronized. The navigation
message $$ D_{\text{B-CNAV1}} $$ has a symbol rate of 100 bit/s.

Since $$ e_{B1C\_pilot}(t) $$ is a complex waveform, the B1C signal contains
three components as shown in the following equation:

$$ \begin{equation}
s^{\text{(BeiDou B1C)}}_{T}(t) = e_{B1C\_data}(t) + e_{B1C\_pilot\_b}(t) + je_{B1C\_pilot\_a}(t) ~,
\end{equation} $$

where:

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
e_{B1C\_data}(t) & = &\frac{1}{2} \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{B-CNAV1}}(t) \oplus C_{B1C\_data}(t) \cdot \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \cdot~\text{sign} \left(\sin \left(2 \pi f_{sc\_B1C\_a} t \right) \right) p(t - lT_{c,B1C\_data})~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
e_{B1C\_pilot\_b}(t) & = & \sqrt{\frac{1}{11}} \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} C_{B1C\_pilot}(t) \cdot \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \cdot~\text{sign} \left(\sin \left(2 \pi f_{sc\_B1C\_b} t \right) \right)  p(t - lT_{c,B1C\_pilot})~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

and

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
e_{B1C\_pilot\_a}(t) & = & \sqrt{\frac{29}{44}} \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} C_{B1C\_pilot}(t) \cdot \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \cdot~\text{sign} \left(\sin \left(2 \pi f_{sc\_B1C\_a} t \right) \right) p(t - lT_{c,B1C\_pilot})~.
\end{eqnarray} $$


### BeiDou B2I

BeiDou B2, centered at $$ f_{B2} = 1207.140 $$ MHz, features a QPSK(2)
modulation. The complex baseband transmitted signal can be written as:[^Beidou]

$$ \begin{equation}
s^{\text{(BeiDou B2)}}_{T}(t) = e_{B2I}(t) + j e_{B2Q}(t)~,
\end{equation} $$

with:

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
e_{B2I}(t) & = & \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} C_{NH} \Big[ |m|_{20} \Big] \oplus \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{B2I}}\Big[ [l]_{40920}\Big] \oplus \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \oplus~C_{B2I} \Big[ |l|_{2046} \Big] p(t - mT_{c,\text{B2I}_{CH}} - lT_{c,\text{B2I}_{C}})~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{B2Q}(t) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{B2Q}} \Big[ [l]_{N/A} \Big] \oplus C_{B2Q} \Big[ |l|_{L_{C_{B2Q}}} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,B2Q})~,
\end{equation} $$

where the chip period is $$ T_{c,\text{B2I}_{C}} = \frac{1}{2.046} $$ $$ \mu $$s
and the code length is 2046 chips. The data message $$ D_{\text{B2I}} $$ varies
depending on the type of transmitting satellite:

  * In MEO/IGSO satellites, the broadcast navigation message structure is known
  as D1, and it contains basic navigation data (fundamental NAV information of
  the broadcasting satellites, almanac information for all satellites as well as
  the time offsets from other systems). It is modulated by a Neumann-Hoffman
  secondary code at 1 kbit/s (so $$ T_{c,\text{B2I}_{CH}} = 1 $$ ms), defined as $$
  C_{NH} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0) $$, and
  the data bits are transmitted at 50 bit/s.

  * In GEO satellites, the broadcast navigation message structure is known as
  D2, and it contains basic navigation data plus augmentation service
  information (the BDS integrity, differential, and ionospheric grid
  information). It is not modulated by the secondary code $$ C_{NH}$$, and the
  data rate is 500 bit/s. Thus, the B2I signals for geostationary satellites can
  be expressed as:

  $$ \begin{equation} e_{B2I}(t)^{(GEO)} = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{D2}}\Big[ [l]_{4092}\Big] \oplus C_{\text{B2I}} \Big[ |l|_{2046} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{B2I}})~. \end{equation} $$

Details of the $$ e_{B2Q}(t) $$ component have not been disclosed.

As stated in the ICD[^Beidou], *"B2I will be gradually replaced by a better
signal with the construction of global system"*. That new "better signal" is
B2a, described below.

### BeiDou B2a

BeiDou B2a signals, transmitted by Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites and the
Inclined GeoSynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites of BDS-3, are centered at  $$
f_{B2a} = 1176.45 $$ MHz, featuring a data channel with a BPSK(10) modulation in
the I component, and a pilot channel with a BPSK(10) modulation in the Q
component:[^BeidouB2a]

$$ \begin{equation}
s^{\text{(BeiDou B2a)}}_{T}(t) = e_{B2aI}(t) + j e_{B2aQ}(t)~,
\end{equation} $$

with

$$ \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \begin{equation}
e_{B2aI}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} \! D_{\text{B-CNAV2}}\Big[ [l]_{51150}\Big] \oplus C_{\text{B2aI}} \Big[ |l|_{10230} \Big] p(t \! - \! lT_{c,\text{B2aI}})~,
\end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation}
e_{B2aQ}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty}  C_{\text{B2aQ}}  \Big[ |l|_{10230} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{B2aI}})~,
\end{equation} $$

where $$ T_{c,\text{B2aI}} = T_{c,\text{B2aQ}} = \frac{1}{10.23} $$ $$\mu $$s,
and the navigation message $$ D_{\text{B-CNAV2}} $$ has a symbol rate of $$ 200 $$
bit/s.

This signal replaces the former B2I defined in version 2.1 of the ICD[^Beidou].


### BeiDou B3I

BeiDou B3I signals, transmitted by Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites and the
Inclined GeoSynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites of BDS-2 and BDS-3, are centered
at $$ f_{B3I} = 1268.520 $$ MHz and feature a data channel with a BPSK(10)
modulation:[^BeidouB3I]

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
e_{B3I}(t) & = & \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} C_{NH} \Big[ |m|_{20} \Big] \oplus \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{B3I}}\Big[ [l]_{204600}\Big] \oplus \nonumber \\
{} & {} & \oplus ~C_{\text{B3I}} \Big[ |l|_{10230} \Big] p(t - mT_{c,\text{B3I}_{CH}} - lT_{c,\text{B3I}_{C}})~,
\end{eqnarray} $$

where $$ T_{c,\text{B3I}_{C}} = \frac{1}{10.23} $$ $$\mu $$s and the code length
of $$ C_{\text{B3I}} $$ is 10230 chips.

The data message $$ D_{\text{B3I}} $$ varies depending on the type of
transmitting satellite:

  * In MEO/IGSO satellites, the broadcast navigation message structure is known
  as D1, and it contains basic navigation data (fundamental NAV information of
  the broadcasting satellites, almanac information for all satellites as well as
  the time offsets from other systems). It is modulated by a Neumann-Hoffman
  secondary code at 1 kbit/s (so $$ T_{c,\text{B3I}_{CH}} = 1 $$ ms), defined as $$
  C_{NH} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0) $$, and
  the data bits $$ D_{\text{B3I}} $$ are transmitted at 50 bit/s.

  * In GEO satellites, the broadcast navigation message structure is known as
  D2, and it contains basic navigation data plus augmentation service
  information (the BDS integrity, differential and ionospheric grid
  information). It is not modulated by the secondary code $$ C_{NH}$$, and the
  data rate is 500 bit/s. Thus, the B3I signals for geostationary satellites can
  be expressed as:

  $$ \begin{equation} e_{B3I}(t)^{(GEO)} = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} D_{\text{D2}}\Big[ [l]_{20460}\Big] \oplus C_{\text{B3I}} \Big[ |l|_{10230} \Big] p(t - lT_{c,\text{B3I}})~. \end{equation} $$

Details of the $$ e_{B3Q}(t) $$ component have not been disclosed.
