GNSS signal spoofing has become a frequent and concerning issue, particularly in regions experiencing military conflicts. This phenomenon can be easily monitored through various online platforms that utilize ADS-B data to detect and display, in near-real time, instances of aircraft being [jammed](http://gpsjam.org) or [spoofed](https://spoofing.skai-data-services.com) worldwide. In such scenarios, GNSS signal authentication emerges as a critical feature to mitigate the effects of spoofing. This can be achieved by detecting spoofed signals and either adequately warning the user, or by excluding non-authenticated satellite products in the computation of the Position, Velocity, and Time (PVT) solutions.

Galileo, the European GNSS, is currently testing its Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) service. OSNMA is designed to provide a secure, spoof-proof communication channel between satellites and receivers. This service transmits authentication data within the Galileo E1 I/NAV messages, alongside the navigation data used by receivers to compute PVT solutions. By incorporating OSNMA, the resilience of GNSS receivers to spoofing attacks is significantly enhanced, since they can detect spoofed signals and act upon that event.

OSNMA makes use of different keys from a single one-way chain shared by the Galileo satellites through a Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA) protocol.[^Perrig03]

The main idea of the TESLA protocol is that the sender appends a message authentication code (MAC) to each data packet, computed using a key $$ K $$ known only to the sender. The receiver buffers the received packet without being able to authenticate it immediately. Shortly afterward, the sender discloses $$ K $$, allowing the receiver to authenticate the packet.
{: .notice--info}

The OSNMA data is broadcast across multiple Galileo satellites, requiring the receiver to combine the received data effectively to implement the service. Consequently, the proposed software architecture includes a processing block that asynchronously collects the OSNMA data received from all available Galileo E1 OS processing channels. This block then combines and processes the OSNMA data, and asynchronously transmits the list of authenticated satellites to the PVT computation block, which, based on user configuration, either warns the user or excludes unauthenticated satellites from the PVT solution computation.

From the user perspective, the required steps involve registering and logging on the [European GNSS Service Centre website](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/) to download the necessary OSNMA Public Key and Merkle Tree root files. The required files are under GSC Products > OSNMA_Publickey (the required file ends with `.crt`, at the time of writing this note it is named `OSNMA_PublicKey_20240115100000_newPKID_1.crt`) and GSC Products > OSNMA_Merkletree (the required file ends with `.xml`, at the time of writing this note it is named `OSNMA_MerkleTree_20240115100000_newPKID_1.xml`). Once donwloaded, the user can set their paths in the GNSS-SDR configuration file:

```ini
GNSS-SDR.osnma_public_key=./OSNMA_PublicKey_20240115100000_newPKID_1.crt
GNSS-SDR.osnma_merkletree=./OSNMA_MerkleTree_20240115100000_newPKID_1.xml
```

The GNSS-SDR receiver can be configured with options such as OSNMA disabled, enabled with warnings, or strict authenticated-only PVT fixes. By default, the ONSMA operation in configured as enabled with warnings if there are channels devoted to the Galileo E1 OS signal (named `1B` in GNSS-SDR terminology). This can be disabled by setting:

```ini
GNSS-SDR.osnma_enable=false
```

The strict mode (that is, PVT fixes are computed exclusively from authenticated signals) can be activated by setting:

```ini
GNSS-SDR.osnma_mode=strict
```

## Extraction of OSNMA data from signals in space

According to the Signal-In-Space Interface Control Document,[^OSNMA-ICD] the Galileo OSNMA protocol data are transmitted within the odd pages of the nominal E1-B I/NAV message. The bits are placed in previously reserved positions:

![OSNMA data]({{ "/assets/images/OSNMA_data.png" | relative_url }}){:width="500px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
*E1-B I/NAV Nominal Page with bits allocation (from OSNMA SIS-ICD[^OSNMA-ICD]).*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

OSNMA data are distributed only by a subset of the Galileo satellites. If a satellite is not part of the above mentioned subset, the I/NAV OSNMA message will contain a 40-bit sequence of zeros. 

The OSNMA field has the following structure: 

![OSNMA message]({{ "/assets/images/OSNMA_msg.png" | relative_url }}){:width="200px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
*OSNMA data message (from OSNMA SIS-ICD [^OSNMA-ICD]).*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

- **The HKROOT (header and root key) section** is an 8-bit portion of a 120 bits long message, which is transmitted once every 30 seconds, *i.e.* within each E1B I/NAV sub-frame. The HKROOT message begins always with an 8-bit NMA Header field, followed by a 112-bit Digital Signature Message (DSM) field, consisting of a DSM Header, followed by a DSM block:

  ![HKROOT message]({{ "/assets/images/HKROOT.png" | relative_url }}){:width="600px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
  *HKROOT Message (from OSNMA SIS-ICD [^OSNMA-ICD]).*
  {: style="text-align: center;"}

  Several DSM blocks, transmitted through successive subframes, form a complete DSM. Different satellites can transmit different blocks of the same DSM at a given sub-frame.

  There are two different types of DSM:
    - DSM-PKR, providing the Public Key for the verification of the root key of the TESLA chain. The Public Key in force, together with its ID and signature algorithm, is provided in the DSM-PKR message every 6 hours (starting at 00:00 GST, 06:00 GST, 12:00 GST and 18:00 GST) for a period of 30 minutes. If the Public Key has not been provided by the user in the `GNSS-SDR.osnma_public_key` configuration parameter, the receiver will retrieve it from the signals in space.
    - DSM-KROOT, providing a digitally signed root key for the TESLA chain in force, or the one of the next chain, and the means to authenticate those keys using the Public Key in force.

- **The MACK (message authentication code and key) section** is a 32-bit portion of a 480 bits long message, which is transmitted once every 30 seconds, *i.e.* within each E1-B I/NAV sub-frame. Each MACK message contains several truncated Message Authentication Codes (MACs), or tags, with specific information data associated (Tag-Info), and a TESLA key.

  ![MACK message]({{ "/assets/images/MACK.png" | relative_url }}){:width="300px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
  *MACK Message (from OSNMA SIS-ICD [^OSNMA-ICD]).*
  {: style="text-align: center;"}

Therefore, a 120-bit HKROOT message and a 480-bit MACK message are transmitted every 30 seconds. Both HKROOT and MACK messages are split into 15 portions of equal size (8 or 32 bits) and transmitted within each 40-bit OSNMA data message.

In OSNMA, the MAC algorithm used to authenticate the *plain text* navigation message can be either HMAC-SHA-256[^FIPS-198-1] or CMAC-AES[^ISO-9797-1], the former being used in the Testing phase. The TESLA keys belong to a chain that begins with a random seed key $$ K_N $$, known only to the sender (in this case, the OSNMA provider), and ends with a root key $$ K_0 $$ that is public and certified through the DSM-KROOT messages. A TESLA key $$ K_N $$ can be verified against the root key $$ K_0 $$ by computing $$ F^N(K_N) $$ and comparing the result with $$ K_0 $$. In OSNMA, the function $$ F(\cdot) $$ is defined in the ICD[^OSNMA-ICD]. 

  ![TESLA key chain]({{ "/assets/images/TESLA_chain.png" | relative_url }}){:width="600px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
  *TESLA key chain, where $$ K_{n} = F(K_{n+1}) $$.*
  {: style="text-align: center;"}

The TESLA root key $$ K_0 $$ retrieved from the DSM-KROOT message is verified using an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)[^FIPS-186-5], by signing the data with a private key known only to the OSNMA provider and verifying it at the receiver with a public cryptographic key. That ECDSA Public Key can be either retrieved from the [European GNSS Service Centre website](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/) and passed to GNSS-SDR via the `GNSS-SDR.osnma_public_key` configuration parameter, or from the Signal in Space broadcasted by Galileo satellites. The Public Key in force, together with its ID and signature algorithm, is provided in the DSM-PKR message every 6 hours for a period of 30 minutes, mixed with other DSM-KROOT messages. The receiver must authenticate this reception against a [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) root $$ x_{4, 0} $$ (see figure below), using the same hashing algorithm that was employed for tree generation, currently SHA-256[^FIPS-180-4]. In the future, the system may adopt SHA3-256[^FIPS-202].

  ![OSNMA Merkle Tree]({{ "/assets/images/MerkleTree.png" | relative_url }}){:width="600px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
  *OSNMA Merkle Tree (from OSNMA SIS-ICD [^OSNMA-ICD]).*
  {: style="text-align: center;"}

Some nodes of the Merkle Tree (among them, the root node $$ x_{4, 0} $$) can be retrieved from the [European GNSS Service Centre website](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/) and passed to GNSS-SDR via the `GNSS-SDR.osnma_merkletree` configuration parameter. Note that a renewal of the Merkle tree is expected to take place very rarely, typically after more than 10 years, so GNSS-SDR already comes with pre-loaded values that are used in the case that `GNSS-SDR.osnma_merkletree` is not defined.

## Processing of the authentication material 

The authentication concept is based on two main principles:

- The use of different keys from a single one-way chain shared by the Galileo satellites through a Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA) protocol.

- The possibility to authenticate satellites which do not transmit OSNMA with the data retrieved from satellites transmitting OSNMA, referred to as cross-authentication. 

From a receiver perspective, the process of the OSNMA data can be described at a high level by the following steps:

- The receiver retrieves the navigation data and the corresponding OSNMA data (tag, TESLA chain key and TESLA root key). The tag authenticates the navigation data and is received before its associated TESLA chain key.
- The TESLA root key is authenticated by means of its digital signature using a Public Key that must be available at the receiver.
- The receiver authenticates the TESLA chain key with the TESLA root key or with a previously authenticated key from the TESLA chain.
- The receiver re-generates locally the tag with the verified TESLA chain key and the data, and checks whether it coincides with the received tag. 

If the result of all these steps is successful the user can consider the navigation data as authentic. [^OSNMA-RG]

  *OSNMA processing logic (from the OSNMA Receiver Guidelines [^OSNMA-RG]).*
  {: style="text-align: center;"}


OSNMA defines different Authentication Data & Key Delay (ADKD) types. Each type authenticates different parts of the I/NAV data transmitted by satellites which is used to generate the associated tag. A tag is defined as a truncated Message Authentication Code (MAC). The currently defined types (others could be defined in future versions of the ICD) are:

- **Tag ADKD=0 - Galileo I/NAV Ephemeris, Clock and Status:**  The tag authenticates I/NAV data transmitted in the previous I/NAV sub-frame. The data authenticated are Word Types 1 to 5, retrieved from either E1-B or E5b-I, including: IODnav, Ephemeris, SISA(E1,E5b), SVID, Clock correction, Ionospheric correction, BGDs, HS and DVS flags.

- **Tag ADKD=4 - Galileo I/NAV Timing Parameters:** The tag authenticates the I/NAV data from the Word Type 6 transmitted one sub-frame earlier and the Word Type 10, transmitted one or two subframes earlier (retrieved from E1-B only). The data authenticated includes: GST-UTC conversion parameters (Word Type 6) and GST-GPS conversion parameters (Word Type 10).

- **Tag ADKD=12 - Slow MAC - Galileo I/NAV Ephemeris, Clock and Status:** The tag is generated as per ADKD=0 definition, but using a key that is published with an additional 10 sub-frames delay (5 minutes).

The possible sequences of transmitted tags (either for self-authentication or cross-authentication of satellite data) are predefined in a look-up table. In those sequences, some slots are fixed, and others are flexible (not defined in the look-up table) and its content definition (which is found in the Tag-Info data) needs to be authenticated through the corresponding TESLA key.

The truncated Message Authentication Codes (MACs), or tags, with specific information data associated (Tag-Info), and the TESLA key are conveyed in the MACK messages described above. Looking into their structure in more detail, there is a MACK header defined as:

  ![MACK header]({{ "/assets/images/MACK_header.png" | relative_url }}){:width="200px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
  *MACK message header (from OSNMA SIS-ICD [^OSNMA-ICD]).*
  {: style="text-align: center;"}

The $$ \text{Tag}_{0} $$ field contains a tag obtained by truncating a MAC of type ADKD=0 for the satellite transmitting the OSNMA data, and it is always the first tag of the MACK message. THE MACSEQ field allows the receiver to authenticate the Tag-Info field for the tags whose ADKD type is identified as flexible, and the Data Cut-Off Point (COP) indicates the maximum time lag between the tag and the navigation data it authenticates.

The next field in the MACK message is Tags&Info, defined as a sequence of tags and their corresponding Tag-Info data:

  ![MACK Tags&Info]({{ "/assets/images/MACK_tags_info.png" | relative_url }}){:width="400px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
  *MACK message's Tags&Info field (from OSNMA SIS-ICD [^OSNMA-ICD]).*
  {: style="text-align: center;"}

The tags are obtained by generating a certain MAC, following the specific information within the Tag-Info field, and then truncating it (starting from the MSB) to the length defined by the Tag Size field within the DSM-KROOT of the chain in force.

A possible example of received tag sequence, spanning two MACK messages, is:

```
00S, FLX, 04S, FLX, 12S, 00E, 00S, FLX, 00E, 12S, 00E, 12E
```
{: class="no-copy"}

where the first 2 characters define the ADKD and the last character means `S` for self-authentication, or `E` for Galileo cross-authentication. For example, `12S` means ADKD=12, self-authentication; and `00E` means ADKD=0, Galileo cross-authentication. The slots marked as `FLX` are flexible, as they are not fixed in the look-up table, and their Tag-Info data required to generate them are authenticated via the MACSEQ field.

The OSNMA-equipped receiver must store these sequences of tags. In the next sub-frame (or ten sub-frames later for ADKD=12), it will receive the TESLA key that allows it to compute the MAC and, consequently, the tags. The receiver can then compare the computed tags to the received sequence. If they match, the received data can be declared authenticated.

## Implementation of cryptographic functions in GNSS-SDR

The OSNMA protocol requires the availability of two secure hash standards (SHA-256 and SHA3-256), two message authentication code functions (HMAC-SHA-256 and CMAC-AES) for tag verification, and two Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithms (ECDSA P-256 and ECDSA P-521) for the verification of the TESLA root key. In the testing phase, only SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-256, and ECDSA P-256 are used, but the others could be used in the future.

Implementing cryptographic functions in C++ from scratch is often unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, leveraging well-known, reliable, and actively maintained open-source libraries ensures robust and secure implementations. These libraries undergo continuous testing and updates, benefiting from scrutiny by a vast user base. In the GNSS-SDR implementation, the objective was to enable the OSNMA service across the broadest possible range of hardware and software environments, covering diverse setups such as embedded SoC/FPGA-based platforms, a Raspberry Pi 5, an x86-64-based personal computer, or even an M3 Apple's silicon processor working on a macOS environment. The required open-source dependency options, which are transparent to the user and automatically picked up by the build configuration system upon availability, are:

- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication. Versions 1.x were published under a dual-license scheme that was incompatible with the GPLv3.0 license, preventing the library from being a mandatory dependency for GNSS-SDR in most GNU/Linux distributions. OpenSSL 1.1.1, relesed on Sep 11th, 2018, already implemented the required OSNMA functions. The licensing issue was resolved in OpenSSL version 3.0.0, which transitioned to the Apache License 2.0, fully compatible with GPLv3.0. Released on Sep 7th, 2021, OpenSSL 3.0.0 and its subsequent updates support the implementation of all cryptographic functions required by the OSNMA service and have been incorporated into major GNU/Linux distributions released since 2022. For instance, in Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions it can be installed as ```sudo apt install libssl-dev```.
- [GnuTLS](https://www.gnutls.org/) is used as a fallback if OpenSSL is not found in the host system when building GNSS-SDR. This Transport Layer Security library, published under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), is available even in older GNU/Linux distributions. However, some operating systems may omit the optional (but necessary) SSL module. For instance, in Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions it can be installed as ```sudo apt install libgnutls-openssl-dev```. It is known to implement all the required OSNMA functions since version 3.6.13, released on Apr 24th, 2020.

## Other open-source OSNMA implementations

Apart from the work presented in this page, there are other very interesting open-source implementations of the OSNMA protocol:

- **[OSNMAlib](https://github.com/Algafix/OSNMA)** is an open-source Python library that can be used for research purposes or be integrated into existing receivers (among them, GNSS-SDR) and applications to incorporate navigation message authentication to the positioning process.[^Galan22] The authors have made relevant contributions to the OSNMA protocol itself,[^Fernandez16] and proposed techniques for shortening the Time To First Authenticated Fix.[^Galan24]

- **[galileo-osnma](https://github.com/daniestevez/galileo-osnma)** is a Rust implementation of the OSNMA protocol that can be used in some embedded microcontrollers.

- **[FGI-OSNMA](https://github.com/nlsfi/fgi-osnma)** is an open-source Python library implementing the OSNMA protocol, and it is delivered by the National Land Survey of Finland. At the moment it only supports the Septentrio Binary Format (SBF), though the SBF can be read from either a file, network socket, or serial port.

## Conclusions

The OSNMA service, in general, and the described GNSS-SDR integration, in particular, represent significant steps forward in enhancing GNSS receiver [reliability]({{ "/design-forces/reliability/" | relative_url }}) in scenarios with potential spoofing attacks. The open-source nature of the presented solutions allows for the early adoption of the OSNMA service and promotes its continuous scrutiny, maintenance, discussion, and potential improvements.
