GNSS-SDR v0.0.7 has been accepted as a software package in [Debian unstable](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/gnss-sdr).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New upload: Accepted gnss-sdr 0.0.7-1 (source) into unstable by Carles Fernandez... <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2016/05/msg01831.html">https://t.co/SZ4dgTgmDb</a></p>&mdash; Debian upload (@DebianUpload) <a href="https://twitter.com/DebianUpload/status/732898563454341120">May 18, 2016</a></blockquote>

Debian's strict admission process guarantees that all files in the source code, as well as all other software dependencies, are adequately released under open source licenses that allow the free distribution of binaries. Software's public distribution and availability is ensured by a robust network of server mirrors around the World. This opens GNSS-SDR to a much wider audience, which can revert in more external contributions, in form of bug detection, bug fixing, addition of new features, more testing, and generation of new ideas.


From now on, installing GNSS-SDR in a Debian (sid) machine is as easy as:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gnss-sdr
```

The DOI for GNSS-SDR v0.0.7 is [10.5281/zenodo.51521](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.51521).
