Scalability refers to the ability of the software to handle a growing amount of
work in a capable manner, or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that
growth.

## Indicators of Scalability

It follows a list of possible scalability indicators for a software-defined GNSS
receiver:

- Quasi-linear acceleration with the number of processors available in the
  computing platform.
- Arbitrarily scalable receiver's software architecture: unlimited addition of
  new GNSS signals and algorithms.
- Arbitrarily scalable configuration system.
- Maximum number of concurrent users.
